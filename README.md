# Javascript

This game uses JavaScript code to move two objects. One of them moves randomly at a specific frame and the second moves so that it collides with him on the front or above. If I could hit him in this way, he would score a point. But if the first object collided the second from the back or above him and record him a point and so until one of them wins and first reach the number of points 10. The object moves the buttons up to the left or right.
